A simple programm that allows you to plot positive and negative steam reviews on a chart over time.

Dependencies:

 'pip install steamreviews'
 'pip install matplotlib'

Open the reviews.py file and edit the gameDict dictionary with the game name and the corresponding Steam ID of the game of your choice.
You can find the ID on steamdb.info. 

Then just run plotting.py and select the json files you've just downloaded.

Here is a picture of how it looks:
